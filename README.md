## GOOGLE BOOKLIKE PROJECT

**1. Created new Project with the following dependicies.**
- React
- TypeScript
- Redux

**2. Created Identical Folder and Source Structure for your projects.**
- Assets
- Types (Interfaces) / Models
- Store
- Components
- Constants
- Pages
- Hooks

**3. Used Redux-ToolKit for fetching data from the following API.**
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/books

**4. Filtering for products**

**5. Like selected Product**

**6. Delete selected Product**

**And I used an endpoint with a token to remove books from my api, but for that need to update the token every 45 minutes, so I commented that endpoint in productSlice.ts.*
